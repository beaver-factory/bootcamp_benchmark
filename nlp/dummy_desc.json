        "Become a software engineer in 13 weeks at our coding bootcamps in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Birmingham and remotely. Unlike our Data Engineering bootcamp where you focus specifically on the 'back-end' of software, or our DevOps Engineering bootcamp that deals specifically with software development and IT operations, our coding bootcamp focuses on building websites and mobile phone apps. The application process takes 2-3 weeks and we would advise you to apply sooner rather than later to give yourself plenty of time to work through the preparation materials. Applicants living in England can apply for DfE funding to cover the entire cost of the course. Get in touch to find out if you qualify.",
        "As a Software Engineer graduate you will be ready to start a career in a variety of coding roles. Throughout this bootcamp you will learn to: create front-end web application with modern JavaScript frameworks such as Angular or React, develop full-stack applications with in-demand technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Python with Django, and Express with Node.js, and integrate third-party application programming interfaces (APIs) in an application.",
        "As a Data Analyst graduate you will be able to problem solve and effectively communicate like an analyst. This course teaches you to use industry-standard tools to make ethical, data-driven decisions. Experience hands-on training to master SQL, Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, and Python â€“ tools listed in virtually every data analytics job posting across industries."
