Our attendees come from diverse backgrounds, including software development, medicine, education, project management, public service, finance, and more. Our experienced teaching team has iteratively refined the curriculum so you can tackle real world problems right away. Our hands-on curriculum will get you started with practical data science and data engineering in just 5 days: Learn the theory and practice of data science and engineering using state of the art tools Explore, visualize, and cluster data Build and evaluate predictive models for classification and regression Design online experiments Build an end-to-end internet of things (IoT) solution. Through hands-on exercises, you will be exposed to a variety of technologies: Hive, Spark, Mahout, Hadoop, stream processors, data ingestors. Learn more by visiting our curriculum page, or for a quick overview, download our course outline. After the bootcamp, our mentors will guide you as you take on new data science problems through Kaggle competitions."

You\u2019ll learn the skills to build websites and discuss code confidently. The focus will be on HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and JQuery but we also cover other topics such as  Git and Github, pair programming, clean code, responsive design and accessible development.\r\n\r\n You will work on multiple projects throughout the course to gain practical experience and have work to take away to include in a portfolio and show to potential employers. Our classes are informal and fun and we encourage openness and questions without ego or competition. At the end of the course, you'll have the opportunity to complete a 2-week internship with one of our partners.\r\n\r\nWhen you study with us, you'll also be paying for a disadvantaged woman in Mumbai to learn digital skills as part of our India project. \r\n\r\n Visit our website to read some of our students' stories and find out more. \r\n"
